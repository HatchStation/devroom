          %p DevRoom is an attempt to improve conversations among developers at workplaces.

          %p Thanks to the ever changing nature of technology, a single day in the lives of most developers involves learning new things, reading docs, building stuff, breaking stuff and pushing the shiny parts to the world.
          
          %p This experience although enriching in it's own way also has the downside of losing time trying to do the same things over and over again.
